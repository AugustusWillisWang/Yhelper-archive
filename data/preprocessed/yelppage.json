The family (Dad, Mom, Sister, and Wife) and I realized our mistake after seeing a Help-Wanted Pizzero sign.Now back to the review...Impressively offering the gamut of Louisiana cuisines, CAJUN - CREOLE - GULF COAST - SOUTHERN, starring the Lord of All Delicatessens - Crawfish, Hank's menu is sure to please all palates.Mom, Sis and I order 5 lbs. of mild, 3 lbs. of medium, and 3 lbs. of spicy crawfish at the market price of $5.99 per Lb. Not a fan, Dad orders the Shrimp Platter ($5.99) while the wife orders a Shrimp Po'boy ($6.99) as a backup option to her recently acquired affinity to the mudbug.Decoratively speaking the main dining area walls are a painted panoramic mural of a funky un-cluttered Mardi Gra-ish quasi-Gulf Coast Mississippi River Florida New Orleans theme encompassing the breadth of the restaurant. \u00a0As for the people-watching I'm excitedly impressed to see the large number of Creoles dining. Obviously, Hank is doing something right for attracting such a bunch.I wished Yelp had a .05 deduction but my reason for not giving a five-star review is due to the server area located in the middle of the restaurant. I understand the concept, a somewhat backyard crawfish boil with server's at attention ready for delivering crustaceans which makes for extraordinary service. In reality it comes off as 5 or 6 waiters standing around watching as you eat, sort of uncomfortable.After ten minutes the waiter delivers via stainless steel bowl the caviar of crustaceans to the table. Immediately, the family gasps in unison. WOW THEY ARE HUGE! They are almost as big as my hand; however, bigger is not always better as my crawfish senses are on high-alert. Skeptically grabbing the first of many, hoping for an explosion of flavor, I proceed to pinch tail and suck head. The shell is not hard, the claws are crunchy, and the crawfish is juicy, savory, succulent, lightly salted, and clean. \u00a0Perfectly delicious!Oh and that is not all, laurel resting naught, as if prepared by the one himself the spice level gets progressively hotter in a maneuver only master cooks have acquired. \u00a0I could easily distinguish between mild, medium, and spicy.Hank's Crawfish does not at all disappoint. I wholeheartedly recommend bringing out the family, getting together with friends, or even inviting visitors to experience Louisiana style cooking on Westheimer in the Westchase District.
