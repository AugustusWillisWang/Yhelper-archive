They had several meals on special so I ordered the blackened tilapia shrimp etoufee, rice \u0026 garlic bread. The food was ok, nothing special and lacked lots of flavor.

I have been going to the Hanks Crawfish restaurants for a few years now, and have not found any other restaurant that can compete with them. Their crawfish are always full of flavor and are very juicy. My fav flavor to get is the med-spicy with garlic. This flavor has just enough spice in it to make you continuously grab your cold glass of water, but just enough flavor to not make you want to stop lol... I have a high tolerance for spicy foods, but the spicy flavor here is entirely too spicy.

It's not my favorite in town but it's not horrible and they are nicely sized. The medium spice is very hot. I got the mild the last time we went and it was more to my liking. They usually have a buy 3 lbs get 1 free. You add corn, sausage, potatoes seperately, I think they are 50 cents each.

It turned out to be a wonderful experience but please note before entering make sure to use the door next to the outdoor patio. The family (Dad, Mom, Sister, and Wife) and I realized our mistake after seeing a Help-Wanted Pizzero sign. \n\nNow back to the review...Impressively offering the gamut of Louisiana cuisines, CAJUN - CREOLE - GULF COAST - SOUTHERN, starring the Lord of All Delicatessens - Crawfish, Hank's menu is sure to please all palates.\n\nMom, Sis and I order 5 lbs. of mild, 3 lbs. of medium, and 3 lbs. of spicy crawfish at the market price of $5.99 per Lb. Not a fan, Dad orders the Shrimp Platter ($5.99) while the wife orders a Shrimp Po'boy ($6.99) as a backup option to her recently acquired affinity to the mudbug. \n\nDecoratively speaking the main dining area walls are a painted panoramic mural of a funky un-cluttered Mardi Gra-ish quasi-Gulf Coast Mississippi River Florida New Orleans theme encompassing the breadth of the restaurant.  As for the people-watching I'm excitedly impressed to see the large number of Creoles dining. Obviously, Hank is doing something right for attracting such a bunch.\n\nI wished Yelp had a .05 deduction but my reason for not giving a five-star review is due to the server area located in the middle of the restaurant. I understand the concept, a somewhat backyard crawfish boil with server's at attention ready for delivering crustaceans which makes for extraordinary service. In reality it comes off as 5 or 6 waiters standing around watching as you eat, sort of uncomfortable.\n\nAfter ten minutes the waiter delivers via stainless steel bowl the caviar of crustaceans to the table. Immediately, the family gasps in unison. WOW THEY ARE HUGE! They are almost as big as my hand; however, bigger is not always better as my crawfish senses are on high-alert. Skeptically grabbing the first of many, hoping for an explosion of flavor, I proceed to pinch tail and suck head. The shell is not hard, the claws are crunchy, and the crawfish is juicy, savory, succulent, lightly salted, and clean.  Perfectly delicious! \n\nOh and that is not all, laurel resting naught, as if prepared by the one himself the spice level gets progressively hotter in a maneuver only master cooks have acquired.  I could easily distinguish between mild, medium, and spicy.  \n\nHank's Crawfish does not at all disappoint. I wholeheartedly recommend bringing out the family, getting together with friends, or even inviting visitors to experience Louisiana style cooking on Westheimer in the Westchase District. Enjoy!", "author": "Abe G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-07-25", "description": "Haven't tried the other locations, but this one is OK. \n-Crawfish was bland \n-wings was not good \n-fried rice was OK", "author": "Ha C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-10-21", "description": "Hanks! \nReally great place to go during the week, and eat some Great Cajun food.\n\nYou won't be disappointed, prices are great!!", "author": "Jay R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-02-27", "description": "Don't go here with a large group. They automatically charge for gratuity on any party over 6. This means the server is already getting a tip. My drink which cost 8.50 got stuck to the table and the glass broke. They came and cleaned it up and not a single person asked if I wanted it replaced. 10 mintues later my server asked me what happen. I took one sip out of it and the glass broke. He asked if I wanted another one which he then charged me another 8.50 for. They charge for every little item u get.

I made a quick phone call to order 2lbs of crawfish (live not frozen which cost $6.99) and fried rice \u0026 5 piece chicken wing combo. It only took about 15mins to fill my order.\n\nWalking into the restaurant you will notice to the left a huge crocodile leaning on a sign that states \"Voted Best Crawfish House in Town!!!\" with a Yelp and its symbol (See the added photo) too. So what conclusion did I make? It was good but not the voted the best. I wonder by whom? \n\nI got the medium spicy flavored crawfish and it was delicious and spicy (New Orleans's style seasoning). It doesn't take that much heat to get me sweating and the beads of sweat came pouring down.  I devoured all of the crawfish. The sizes of the crawfish ranged from small to medium but that's because it is only the beginning of the season. I wouldn't say it is the best crawfish in Houston but, it was good. I put it just a notch below the best places in Houston.  The fried rice was very similar to Vietnamese fried rice which was perfectly cooked with rice, shrimp, and eggs. The wings didn't have much flavor but, the rice made up for it.\n\nI'll be coming back to this place but I would suggest having a really cute hostess working the front to entice more patrons.", "author": "Anthony N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-05-08", "description": "I went yesterday for the first time and I was sadly disappointed.

We arrived around 7:05 and told it was a 45 minute wait. We left and returned 40 minutes later, the hostess told us a table was being cleaned with our name on it. After at least another 15 minutes, 5 more tables become clean and open, however no one is being seated. One waiter sat at the pos station, chatting up a young lady, carelessly forgetting about his tables. We figured his actions, and us waiting way to long for a table (when plenty were empty) was a sign of bad service to come so we decided to leave. \n\nThis is not a food review due to not being able to actually try the food. Just a review of the service, and a prediction of bad service from the point of walking in to paying your tab.", "author": "RJ K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-03-05", "description": "I love crawfish! This place is the bomb. Really the crawfish were in season so they were huge. I ordered two dozen extremely hot no refunds. They were so SPICY but delicious.  I orederd a hurricane but it was toooooo sweet, they let you sample the drink before you order the glass thank goodness for that.

             Had the 4 fried shrimp and 4 oysters.  Both were pretty good in size, also side salad with fries. Not bad but priced too high in my opinion. $25

             Came here after church Sunday afternoon &amp; was greeted by the hostess. She was very sweet and the place had a New Orleans feel but beyond that wasnt so appealing. They had several meals on special so I ordered the blackened tilapia shrimp etoufee, rice &amp; garlic bread. The food was ok, nothing special and lacked lots of flavor. My fish was overcooked, flavorless and dry and the proportion of etoufee doesn't match the ice-cream scoop of rice you get. I love cajun food but I expected better from Hank's &amp; just didnt get it..

             Came here for lunch My girlfriend and I ordered lunch special : gumbo and smoke sausage rice and beans. Both dishes were okay to me. Both dishes were very reasonable priced at 5.99$ each. 

We also ordered crawfish @ 6.99 lbs. Crawfish was good. I'd come back.

             This is by far, my fave place to get crawfish. I have been going to the Hanks Crawfish restaurants for a few years now, and have not found any other restaurant that can compete with them. Their crawfish are always full of flavor and are very juicy. My fav flavor to get is the med-spicy with garlic. This flavor has just enough spice in it to make you continuously grab your cold glass of water, but just enough flavor to not make you want to stop lol... I have a high tolerance for spicy foods, but the spicy flavor here is entirely too spicy. Don't say i didnt warn you...

i buy from here at least twice a week, i promise you, this is the best place to get crawfish !!!!!!!!

             We have been twice for the crawfish and it's good. It's not my favorite in town but it's not horrible and they are nicely sized. The medium spice is very hot. I got the mild the last time we went and it was more to my liking. They usually have a buy 3 lbs get 1 free. You add corn, sausage, potatoes seperately, I think they are 50 cents each. When you are done they will bring you a bowl of water to wash your hands which is nice and saves you a trip to the restroom.

             Great place to get crawfish! The garlic butter mix has to be my favorite! Haven't tried too many other things on the menu but will definitely return to give it a go.

             The best place so far for crawfish in Houston to me!!! I usually get the spicy garlic with garlic butter... I've also tried the red beans and rice and that was also very good... 

I notice when I do go I see other folks ordering other foods from the menu which also looks just as good! I am HOOKED on the crawfish (no lie)... I absolutely LOVE this place for crawfish! They also have this drink called "Bayou water" only if they would add just a little bit more alcohol that drink would be the bomb.com... 

HA!

             Thank you my fellow Yelpers for recommending Hank's Crawfish.  It turned out to be a wonderful experience but please note before entering make sure to use the door next to the outdoor patio. The family (Dad, Mom, Sister, and Wife) and I realized our mistake after seeing a Help-Wanted Pizzero sign. 

Now back to the review...Impressively offering the gamut of Louisiana cuisines, CAJUN - CREOLE - GULF COAST - SOUTHERN, starring the Lord of All Delicatessens - Crawfish, Hank's menu is sure to please all palates.

Mom, Sis and I order 5 lbs. of mild, 3 lbs. of medium, and 3 lbs. of spicy crawfish at the market price of $5.99 per Lb. Not a fan, Dad orders the Shrimp Platter ($5.99) while the wife orders a Shrimp Po'boy ($6.99) as a backup option to her recently acquired affinity to the mudbug. 

Decoratively speaking the main dining area walls are a painted panoramic mural of a funky un-cluttered Mardi Gra-ish quasi-Gulf Coast Mississippi River Florida New Orleans theme encompassing the breadth of the restaurant.  As for the people-watching I'm excitedly impressed to see the large number of Creoles dining. Obviously, Hank is doing something right for attracting such a bunch.

I wished Yelp had a .05 deduction but my reason for not giving a five-star review is due to the server area located in the middle of the restaurant. I understand the concept, a somewhat backyard crawfish boil with server's at attention ready for delivering crustaceans which makes for extraordinary service. In reality it comes off as 5 or 6 waiters standing around watching as you eat, sort of uncomfortable.

After ten minutes the waiter delivers via stainless steel bowl the caviar of crustaceans to the table. Immediately, the family gasps in unison. WOW THEY ARE HUGE! They are almost as big as my hand; however, bigger is not always better as my crawfish senses are on high-alert. Skeptically grabbing the first of many, hoping for an explosion of flavor, I proceed to pinch tail and suck head. The shell is not hard, the claws are crunchy, and the crawfish is juicy, savory, succulent, lightly salted, and clean.  Perfectly delicious! 

Oh and that is not all, laurel resting naught, as if prepared by the one himself the spice level gets progressively hotter in a maneuver only master cooks have acquired.  I could easily distinguish between mild, medium, and spicy.  

Hank's Crawfish does not at all disappoint. I wholeheartedly recommend bringing out the family, getting together with friends, or even inviting visitors to experience Louisiana style cooking on Westheimer in the Westchase District. Enjoy!

             Don't go here with a large group. They automatically charge for gratuity on any party over 6. This means the server is already getting a tip. My drink which cost 8.50 got stuck to the table and the glass broke. They came and cleaned it up and not a single person asked if I wanted it replaced. 10 mintues later my server asked me what happen. I took one sip out of it and the glass broke. He asked if I wanted another one which he then charged me another 8.50 for. They charge for every little item u get. Many of other places in the area that are better.

             This place has been open for a few months so last night I had hankering for some crawfish after working out.  I made a quick phone call to order 2lbs of crawfish (live not frozen which cost $6.99) and fried rice &amp; 5 piece chicken wing combo. It only took about 15mins to fill my order.

Walking into the restaurant you will notice to the left a huge crocodile leaning on a sign that states "Voted Best Crawfish House in Town!!!" with a Yelp and its symbol (See the added photo) too. So what conclusion did I make? It was good but not the voted the best. I wonder by whom? 

I got the medium spicy flavored crawfish and it was delicious and spicy (New Orleans's style seasoning). It doesn't take that much heat to get me sweating and the beads of sweat came pouring down.  I devoured all of the crawfish. The sizes of the crawfish ranged from small to medium but that's because it is only the beginning of the season. I wouldn't say it is the best crawfish in Houston but, it was good. I put it just a notch below the best places in Houston.  The fried rice was very similar to Vietnamese fried rice which was perfectly cooked with rice, shrimp, and eggs. The wings didn't have much flavor but, the rice made up for it.

I'll be coming back to this place but I would suggest having a really cute hostess working the front to entice more patrons.

             I went yesterday for the first time and I was sadly disappointed. My shrimp was overcooked and the grits were undercooked. The service was pretty good but I definitely won't be recommending this restaurant to anyone.

             Terrible. We arrived around 7:05 and told it was a 45 minute wait. We left and returned 40 minutes later, the hostess told us a table was being cleaned with our name on it. After at least another 15 minutes, 5 more tables become clean and open, however no one is being seated. One waiter sat at the pos station, chatting up a young lady, carelessly forgetting about his tables. We figured his actions, and us waiting way to long for a table (when plenty were empty) was a sign of bad service to come so we decided to leave. 

This is not a food review due to not being able to actually try the food. Just a review of the service, and a prediction of bad service from the point of walking in to paying your tab.

             I love crawfish! This place is the bomb. Really the crawfish were in season so they were huge. I ordered two dozen extremely hot no refunds. They were so SPICY but delicious.  I orederd a hurricane but it was toooooo sweet, they let you sample the drink before you order the glass thank goodness for that. I ended up with a patron margarita.

The service was fast she was super efficient and on top of the orders. I have to stop back by before I go back to the west coast.

             Had a Family night out and decided to try out Hank's Crawfish. We absolutely loved the food. My catfish tasted fresh, the craw fish was very spicy with is a PLUS, but the service was the best part. I really can't remember the waitress name, but I will for sure be returning againg. All her recomendación were amazing, she was fast at refilling our drinks. On top of that she was a new hire. ... Returning and recommending for sure

             This location and it's Hwy 6 location has the best crawfish in the Houston area.  The crawfish are large like jumbo shrimp and they are bursting with flavor due to the fact that they are served in a plastic bag that contains the flavor of your choice. The service was great and they accommodate your messy hands at the end of the meal with a bowl of lemon water and plenty of wipes. There is nothing about the bar to rave about, but the other Cajun menu items may not be authentic but are delicious. I would recommend this place.

             Ordered 2 pounds.  I got them quick. They were very  small. Mushy  and most of them had straight  tails.  I can do a lot better some where else. For 8.99 a pound. . Over 3/4 them were bad the Bartender  was great. She offered  to get me something  else. I went in there for crawfish.  Won't be going back.

                   Came here after church Sunday afternoon &amp; was greeted by the hostess. She was very sweet and the place had a New Orleans feel but beyond that wasnt so appealing. They had several meals on special so I ordered the blackened tilapia shrimp etoufee, rice &amp; garlic bread. The food was ok, nothing special and lacked lots of flavor. My fish was overcooked, flavorless and dry and the proportion of etoufee doesn't match the ice-cream scoop of rice you get. I love cajun food but I expected better from Hank's &amp; just didnt get it..

                   Came here for lunch My girlfriend and I ordered lunch special : gumbo and smoke sausage rice and beans. Both dishes were okay to me. Both dishes were very reasonable priced at 5.99$ each.
                   <br/>
                   <br/>
                   We also ordered crawfish @ 6.99 lbs. Crawfish was good. I'd come back.

                   This is by far, my fave place to get crawfish. I have been going to the Hanks Crawfish restaurants for a few years now, and have not found any other restaurant that can compete with them. Their crawfish are always full of flavor and are very juicy. My fav flavor to get is the med-spicy with garlic. This flavor has just enough spice in it to make you continuously grab your cold glass of water, but just enough flavor to not make you want to stop lol... I have a high tolerance for spicy foods, but the spicy flavor here is entirely too spicy. Don't say i didnt warn you...

                   <br/>
                   i buy from here at least twice a week, i promise you, this is the best place to get crawfish !!!!!!!!

                    <br/>
                    This is my absolute favorite place to come to for crawfish, The flavor i like to choose is medium-spicy with garlic. Its still spicy, but not too spicy to the point where you cant enjoy it. I have a high tolerant with spicy foods, but trust me spicy is entirely too hot.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Other items on the menu are good as well. So if you're not interested in crawfish, no need to worry b/c everything on the menu taste great!

                   We have been twice for the crawfish and it's good. It's not my favorite in town but it's not horrible and they are nicely sized. The medium spice is very hot. I got the mild the last time we went and it was more to my liking. They usually have a buy 3 lbs get 1 free. You add corn, sausage, potatoes seperately, I think they are 50 cents each. When you are done they will bring you a bowl of water to wash your hands which is nice and saves you a trip to the restroom.

                   Thank you my fellow Yelpers for recommending Hank's Crawfish.  It turned out to be a wonderful experience but please note before entering make sure to use the door next to the outdoor patio. The family (Dad, Mom, Sister, and Wife) and I realized our mistake after seeing a Help-Wanted Pizzero sign.
                   <br/>
                   <br/>
                   Now back to the review...Impressively offering the gamut of Louisiana cuisines, CAJUN - CREOLE - GULF COAST - SOUTHERN, starring the Lord of All Delicatessens - Crawfish, Hank's menu is sure to please all palates.
                   <br/>
                   <br/>
                   Mom, Sis and I order 5 lbs. of mild, 3 lbs. of medium, and 3 lbs. of spicy crawfish at the market price of $5.99 per Lb. Not a fan, Dad orders the Shrimp Platter ($5.99) while the wife orders a Shrimp Po'boy ($6.99) as a backup option to her recently acquired affinity to the mudbug.
                   <br/>
                   <br/>
                   Decoratively speaking the main dining area walls are a painted panoramic mural of a funky un-cluttered Mardi Gra-ish quasi-Gulf Coast Mississippi River Florida New Orleans theme encompassing the breadth of the restaurant.  As for the people-watching I'm excitedly impressed to see the large number of Creoles dining. Obviously, Hank is doing something right for attracting such a bunch.
                   <br/>
                   <br/>
                   I wished Yelp had a .05 deduction but my reason for not giving a five-star review is due to the server area located in the middle of the restaurant. I understand the concept, a somewhat backyard crawfish boil with server's at attention ready for delivering crustaceans which makes for extraordinary service. In reality it comes off as 5 or 6 waiters standing around watching as you eat, sort of uncomfortable.
                   <br/>
                   <br/>
                   After ten minutes the waiter delivers via stainless steel bowl the caviar of crustaceans to the table. Immediately, the family gasps in unison. WOW THEY ARE HUGE! They are almost as big as my hand; however, bigger is not always better as my crawfish senses are on high-alert. Skeptically grabbing the first of many, hoping for an explosion of flavor, I proceed to pinch tail and suck head. The shell is not hard, the claws are crunchy, and the crawfish is juicy, savory, succulent, lightly salted, and clean.  Perfectly delicious!
                   <br/>
                   <br/>
                   Oh and that is not all, laurel resting naught, as if prepared by the one himself the spice level gets progressively hotter in a maneuver only master cooks have acquired.  I could easily distinguish between mild, medium, and spicy.
                   <br/>
                   <br/>
                   Hank's Crawfish does not at all disappoint. I wholeheartedly recommend bringing out the family, getting together with friends, or even inviting visitors to experience Louisiana style cooking on Westheimer in the Westchase District. Enjoy!

                   Don't go here with a large group. They automatically charge for gratuity on any party over 6. This means the server is already getting a tip. My drink which cost 8.50 got stuck to the table and the glass broke. They came and cleaned it up and not a single person asked if I wanted it replaced. 10 mintues later my server asked me what happen. I took one sip out of it and the glass broke. He asked if I wanted another one which he then charged me another 8.50 for. They charge for every little item u get. Many of other places in the area that are better.

                   This place has been open for a few months so last night I had hankering for some crawfish after working out.  I made a quick phone call to order 2lbs of crawfish (live not frozen which cost $6.99) and fried rice &amp; 5 piece chicken wing combo. It only took about 15mins to fill my order.
                   <br/>
                   <br/>
                   Walking into the restaurant you will notice to the left a huge crocodile leaning on a sign that states "Voted Best Crawfish House in Town!!!" with a Yelp and its symbol (See the added photo) too. So what conclusion did I make? It was good but not the voted the best. I wonder by whom?
                   <br/>
                   <br/>
                   I got the medium spicy flavored crawfish and it was delicious and spicy (New Orleans's style seasoning). It doesn't take that much heat to get me sweating and the beads of sweat came pouring down.  I devoured all of the crawfish. The sizes of the crawfish ranged from small to medium but that's because it is only the beginning of the season. I wouldn't say it is the best crawfish in Houston but, it was good. I put it just a notch below the best places in Houston.  The fried rice was very similar to Vietnamese fried rice which was perfectly cooked with rice, shrimp, and eggs. The wings didn't have much flavor but, the rice made up for it.
                   <br/>
                   <br/>
                   I'll be coming back to this place but I would suggest having a really cute hostess working the front to entice more patrons.

                   Terrible. We arrived around 7:05 and told it was a 45 minute wait. We left and returned 40 minutes later, the hostess told us a table was being cleaned with our name on it. After at least another 15 minutes, 5 more tables become clean and open, however no one is being seated. One waiter sat at the pos station, chatting up a young lady, carelessly forgetting about his tables. We figured his actions, and us waiting way to long for a table (when plenty were empty) was a sign of bad service to come so we decided to leave.

                   This is not a food review due to not being able to actually try the food. Just a review of the service, and a prediction of bad service from the point of walking in to paying your tab.

                   I love crawfish! This place is the bomb. Really the crawfish were in season so they were huge. I ordered two dozen extremely hot no refunds. They were so SPICY but delicious.  I orederd a hurricane but it was toooooo sweet, they let you sample the drink before you order the glass thank goodness for that. I ended up with a patron margarita.

                   The service was fast she was super efficient and on top of the orders. I have to stop back by before I go back to the west coast.

                   My husband and I have been going there for awhile now. Last night was our first time during  crawfish season and it was super busy but as always the food and drinks were amazing and the staff as always are the best they make you feel so happy and welcomed.  The staff is one of the reasons we keep coming back

                   Had a Family night out and decided to try out Hank's Crawfish. We absolutely loved the food. My catfish tasted fresh, the craw fish was very spicy with is a PLUS, but the service was the best part. I really can't remember the waitress name, but I will for sure be returning againg. All her recomendación were amazing, she was fast at refilling our drinks. On top of that she was a new hire. ... Returning and recommending for sure

                   This location and it's Hwy 6 location has the best crawfish in the Houston area.  The crawfish are large like jumbo shrimp and they are bursting with flavor due to the fact that they are served in a plastic bag that contains the flavor of your choice. The service was great and they accommodate your messy hands at the end of the meal with a bowl of lemon water and plenty of wipes. There is nothing about the bar to rave about, but the other Cajun menu items may not be authentic but are delicious. I would recommend this place.

                   Ordered 2 pounds.  I got them quick. They were very  small. Mushy  and most of them had straight  tails.  I can do a lot better some where else. For 8.99 a pound. . Over 3/4 them were bad the Bartender  was great. She offered  to get me something  else. I went in there for crawfish.  Won't be going back.
